##How To Play
Login with either your GitHub or Twitter account to join that team. You and your teammates will each individually suggest your team's next move. __The most popular square will be your team's collective move!__

Your goal is to win the big tic-tac-toe board by getting __three in a row__ - either across, down, or diagonally - or getting a __majority of the squares in a full grid__. In order to earn one of the nine squares in the big board, you must win the smaller tic-tac-toe board contained within it.

__Your opponent's previous move determines in which board(s) you are allowed to play__. For example, if your opponent chose the top right square of the center board, you would then have to choose an open square in the top right board.

If your opponent's previous move would force you to play in a board which has already been won, you can select any open square on the whole board.
